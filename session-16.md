When executing commands in a shell environment, each command returns a status code that indicates the outcome of its execution. This status is represented by the special variable `$?`. A status code of 0 signifies that the command completed successfully without any errors, while any non-zero value indicates that an issue occurred during its execution. Understanding these status codes is essential for effective shell scripting and debugging, as they provide insight into the success or failure of commands run in the terminal.

To determine whether a particular condition has resulted in success or failure, one can utilize the `if` statement, a fundamental construct in programming.

### Basic Condition Check:
```bash
if condition; then
    # Commands to execute if the condition is true
fi
```
In this structure, the code within the `then` block runs only if the specified condition evaluates to true.

### Conditional Execution with Else:
```bash
if condition; then
    # Commands to execute if the condition is true
else
    # Commands to execute if the condition is false
fi
```
This extended format introduces an `else` clause, allowing for an alternate set of commands to execute when the condition is false, providing a clear path for both scenarios.

### Handling Multiple Conditions with Else-If:
```bash
if [expression1]; then
    # Commands to execute if expression1 is true
elif [expression2]; then
    # Commands to execute if expression2 is true
else
    # Commands to execute if neither expression1 nor expression2 is true
fi
```
The else-if construct enables the evaluation of multiple conditions in sequence. If the first condition (`expression1`) is true, its corresponding commands execute; if not, the program checks the second condition (`expression2`). If neither condition is met, the commands within the `else` block are executed, offering a structured way to handle various possibilities.

These conditional structures allow for sophisticated decision-making in scripts, ensuring the appropriate commands are executed based on the outcome of specified conditions.
