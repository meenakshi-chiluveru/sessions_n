- **ls**: Lists files and directories in the current working directory, providing a view of the contents at a glance.
- **pwd**: Displays the present working directory, showing the full path of your current location in the filesystem.
- **cd**: Changes the directory, allowing navigation through the directory structure to access different files and folders.
- **mkdir**: Creates a new directory, helping to organize files into specified folders for better management.
- **rm**: Removes files or directories, freeing up space but requires caution as deleted items may not be easily recoverable.
- **cp**: Copies files or directories from one location to another, preserving the original data while creating duplicates.
- **mv**: Moves files or directories, allowing you to relocate them or rename them in the process.
- **vi**: A powerful text editor that allows users to create and modify text files efficiently through a command-line interface.
- **tail**: Displays the last few lines of a file, useful for monitoring logs or recent entries without opening the entire file.
- **head**: Shows the first few lines of a file, providing a quick preview of its contents without needing to open it fully.
- **cat**: Concatenates and displays the contents of files, enabling users to view text files in their entirety directly in the terminal.
- **awk**: A versatile programming language designed for text processing and data extraction, commonly used for pattern scanning and reporting.
- **grep**: Searches through text using specified patterns, highlighting lines that match, making it invaluable for searching through large files.
- **curl**: A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs, supporting various protocols like HTTP, FTP, and more for efficient data retrieval.

**Web Applications:**
---------------------------
When a user navigates to a .com website, the information they see is not solely sourced from a single, centralized server; instead, it often incorporates resources from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This means that the delivery of content is distributed across multiple servers, enhancing speed and reliability.

Web applications are typically structured into three fundamental layers: the presentation layer, the business logic layer, and the data layer. These layers work together to create a seamless experience for the user. The presentation layer is what users interact with visually, displaying the content and elements of the application in an engaging and user-friendly manner. The business logic layer serves as the core of the application, processing data and executing the rules that define its behavior. Lastly, the data layer manages the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data, ensuring that information flows efficiently throughout the application.

When we refer to three-tier applications, we highlight this structured approach. However, many modern applications are classified as n-tier applications, which feature numerous services and functionalities distributed across various layers. This architecture allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and the integration of diverse technologies tailored to specific needs. Each layer can be constructed using different programming languages, frameworks, or tools, creating a robust environment that can adapt to changing requirements and technological advancements.
